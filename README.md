### Hi, I'm Ilya

I'm a software engineer, electronics hobbyist and 3D-printing enthusiast.

At my day job I'm building backend infrastructure.

My biggest passion is learning how things work, from a transistor to planet-scale distributed systems.

You can read about my hobby projects [on my website](https://iley.ru/projects/).
